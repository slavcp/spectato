### **THIS CLIENT IS MERELY FOR SPECTATING COMP MATCHES, YOU CANNOT PLAY THE GAME ON IT**

## client features
 - resource swapper **(i meant for the client to be used with custom css; base styles are just what i stumbled upon when i smashed my keyboard)**
 - displays each player's stats on the side of the screen to improve viewer's understanding of the match
 - improved player ordering and re-made number key handling
 - improved player focusing (when a player dies the camera focuses the player that killed them)
 - pre-set camera locations accesible with the press of a button for every tournament map **(SHIFT + number)**
 - central bottom stat display when focusing on a player
 - adjusts *focused* player health bar color according to team color (can change in settings)
 - team kill counters
 - team obj point change counter
 - autoupdater
 
## in the future (never happening)
 - track player health without getting banned
*if any rule breaker knows how to do either of those, let me know ðŸ˜‰*
 - user-made camera tp waypoints
 - more settings to toggle certain features on/off
 - MIGRATE TO [TAURI](https://tauri.app/) (**actually** never happening)

make an issue or dm `slaav` on discord for anything related
